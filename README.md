# Neon Runner 🏃‍♂️💨

An endless 3D runner game built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js! Dodge the gaps, jump over obstacles, and see how far you can run in this neon-infused cyber world! 🌆✨

The game features modular JavaScript architecture, optimized 3D models using Meshopt Decoder, and a modern build pipeline via Vite.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Start Game:** Click Start
- **Move Left/Right:** `A` / `D` or `Left Arrow` / `Right Arrow`
- **Jump:** `Space`

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

The game has been updated to use modern web development tools like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for an improved development experience and a modular codebase.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Setup

1.  Clone the repository and open your terminal in the project directory.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev &
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate optimized static assets in the `dist/` directory.

### Deployment
You can deploy the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service. The project is currently configured to deploy to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` branch:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
